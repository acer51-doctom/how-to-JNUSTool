# Section III: How can I use JNUSTool?

The use of JNUSTool is very simple.

First of all, you're gonna need the TitleID of what you wanna download. <br>
Exemple: American home menu, European Mii Maker, you get it. <br> <br> To get the TitleID you need, refer to (https://wiiubrew.org/wiki/Title_database)[https://wiiubrew.org/wiki/Title_database].

Tho, there's still some SLC files you might need... The Gamepad Keyboard for exemple, which is in the SLC.
